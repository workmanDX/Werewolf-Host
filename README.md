# One Night Werewolf built with LWC

This is a game based on One Night Werewolf that was built to play remotely with family and friends.

The game is made up of two LWC apps, this is the first, which is the host app and during game play is shared over GoToMeeting, Zoom, etc.  The second app is LWC OSS so it can be hosted outside of Salesforce, I use Heroku.  It is the player app and is compatible with large screens and mobile devices.

The player app can be found [here](https://github.com/workmanDX/werewolf-player-dev).

I started with the original source code found [here](https://github.com/fostive/quiz-host-app) and modified it.
